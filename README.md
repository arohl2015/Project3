# Project 3 - Hobby Road
Hobby Road is a full-stack MERN application created by our team for Project 3 of the University of Arizona Coding Bootcamp. This app was designed to assist people in finding new activities and/or hobbies to pursue while we are all navigating this new normal. From gardening to art, we have covered a wide-range of interests that are sure to please any audience.

## Live Demo on Heroku:

You can access the app via this link: [Welcome to Hobby Road](https://frozen-shore-51007.herokuapp.com/)

## To start the application locally:
Start by installing front and backend dependencies. While in this directory, run the following command:
```
npm install
```
This should install node modules within the server and the client folder. After both installations complete, run the following command in your terminal:
```
npm start
```
Your app should now be running on <http://localhost:3000>. The Express server should intercept any AJAX requests from the client.

## Future Enhancements:
As we work to further develop Hobby Road, we'd like to add the following enhancements:
- Allowing stores, parks, and other vendors add their events to our websites.
- A page for authenticated users to save their favorite hobbies.
- Having authenticated users be able to comment on classes/events they have attended and interact with other users.
- Expanding our listed activities/hobbies beyond the six we currently have.
- Linking this to an external API, such as EventBrite, for users to localizer their hobby/activity search by city.
