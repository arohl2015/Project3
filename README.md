# Project 3 - Hobby Road
Hobby Road is a full-stack MERN application created by our team for Project 3 of the University of Arizona Coding Bootcamp. This app was created to assist people in finding new activities and/or hobbies to pursue while we are all navigating this new normal. From gardening to art, we have covered a wide-range of interests that we want to continue expanding on.  

## Live Demo on Heroku:

You can access the app via this link: [Welcome to Hobby Road](https://frozen-shore-51007.herokuapp.com/)

## If you'd like to start the application locally:
Start by installing front and backend dependencies. While in this directory, run the following command:
```
npm install
```
This should install node modules within the server and the client folder. After both installations complete, run the following command in your terminal:
```
npm start
```
Your app should now be running on <http://localhost:3000>. The Express server should intercept any AJAX requests from the client.
